**How I am feeling right now?**

Well, I would say *excited* but also *confused* **:)** I am just at the beginning of learning to use R and then also using GitHub makes it more complicated but it is also a great challenge. I think it will help me a lot to understand my the work of others using R. Besides, it is always good to learn something new!!

**What I am expecting to learn? **
 
* I conducted a clinical research, with made a lot of fun and is very interesting, although I had to handle a lot of stool samples. 
* However, omics data will be analyzed by another PhD student using R. Therefore, I should be able to know how he worked with R and because I am in a big EU project it would be useful to work with open research tools, so that we can better communicate.
* And I need a better understanding in statistics :)
